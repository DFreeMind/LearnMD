## 全文

What is the best way to watch someone who is telling a lie?  For a long time, the traditional method of identifying liars was to watch their body language, including facial expressions. **What if a person apears to nervous**?  What if the person appears to be nervous? **Is the person unable to look me in the eye**? Is he or she looking around the room? **What about other nervous movements, such as fidgeting or shfiting from side to side**?

Many people--from parents to police officers and airport security personnel -- depend on this method. **But does a person's body and face reveal the truth**? Not according to new study. **Taking, it seems, is the best way to smoke out a liar**. That is what researchers in the United Kingdom found out recently. 

**Their investgation took place at one place where lying cant get you into big trouble -- airport**. The researchers asked the volunteers to **pretend** they were real passengers and then lie to airport security agents. Some of the agents used spoken conversation-based methods to question these **make-believe** passengers.  <u>Other agents depended instead on the person's body language, like **lack of eye contact** and **showing signs of** nervousness</u>. <u>The agents taking wiht the passengers were **20 times more likely to** catch the liars.</u>

<u>The study found that these converation-based **techniques** can help you recognize when a person is lying to you</u>. Like many methods, this conversation method has a name. <u>It is called Controlled **Cognitive** Engagement or CCE, for short</u>. The British goverment partly financed this study. The Amercian Psychological Association published the findings. Using body language and facial experssions to catch someone in a lie is really hard. <u>And it only workes, seemingly, by chance</u>. Thomas Ormerod is the head of the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England.  <u>On the APA website, he reported that the "suspicious-signs method" -- or using body language --"almost completely fails" in finding lies</u>. In the conversational CCE method, security agents just talk with passengers. <u>Then the agent observers if the person becomes more evasive or erratic</u>. They also observe if their way of speaking changes. Ormerod says that for actual passengers, they are "just chatting about themselves. <u>it shouln't feel like an **interrogation**</u>."

## 全文

Technology is forever changing the way we get our news. Many people now get a lot of their news on electronic devices, instead of traditional media, such as newpapers, television or radio.  An increasing number of people also report turning to social media for information.

Now, There is a new technology that could greatly the way we get the news: computer-created news readers. Recently, China's state-supported news agency Xinhua launched what i called the world's first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters. Xinhua said it worked with the Chinese search engine Sogou to develop the AI presenters. The news readers - created by machine learning technology - are besed on two real-life Chinese newsmen. One is able to present newscasts in English; the other, in Mandarin Chinese. In Xihua's report about the lanuch, it said machine learning was used to examine video images and sounds of the two newsmen. The system  then created the AI robotic presenters, which look and sound like real people.

Xinhua said the AI presenters will be great improvement to the news team beacuse they "can work 24 hours a day"  on its website and on social media. One of presenters even promised to "work tirelessly" to keep people informed. Xinhua claimed the AI newsmen were able to read the news "as naturally as" a human presenter. Some machine learning experts said the system showed off China's latest progress in voice recognition, text-to-speech technology and data analysis.

On social media, many  Chinese noted that the AI presents did not seem real.  People criticized them for not being more lifelike. On china's Twitter-like service Weibo several users wrote that the news readers have "no soul".  One user joked:"What if we had a AI leader of China?" Others wondered about the effects robots might have on employment and workers. "It all comes down to production costs, which will determine if we loss jobs," one Weibo user wrote. Some people argued that only low-level jobs requiring heavy labor will easily replaced by robots. Others praised the technology as way for companies to make money from low-cost labor machines.

```
“Recently, China’s state-supported news agency Xinhua launched what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters.”
```

在这个句子中，what之后的部分是什么从句？为什么用what而不用that引导？

what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters”是宾语从句，what在句中作launched的宾语。在名词性从句中，连接代词（即wh-一类的疑问代词）在从句中充当某一成分；而that在从句中不充当成分。这里从句中called之后缺宾语，所以这里需要用what而非that。
