## 全文

What is the best way to watch someone who is telling a lie?  For a long time, the traditional method of identifying liars was to watch their body language, including facial expressions. **What if a person apears to nervous**?  What if the person appears to be nervous? **Is the person unable to look me in the eye**? Is he or she looking around the room? **What about other nervous movements, such as fidgeting or shfiting from side to side**?

Many people--from parents to police officers and airport security personnel -- depend on this method. **But does a person's body and face reveal the truth**? Not according to new study. **Taking, it seems, is the best way to smoke out a liar**. That is what researchers in the United Kingdom found out recently. 

**Their investgation took place at one place where lying cant get you into big trouble -- airport**. The researchers asked the volunteers to **pretend** they were real passengers and then lie to airport security agents. Some of the agents used spoken conversation-based methods to question these **make-believe** passengers.  <u>Other agents depended instead on the person's body language, like **lack of eye contact** and **showing signs of** nervousness</u>. <u>The agents taking wiht the passengers were **20 times more likely to** catch the liars.</u>

<u>The study found that these converation-based **techniques** can help you recognize when a person is lying to you</u>. Like many methods, this conversation method has a name. <u>It is called Controlled **Cognitive** Engagement or CCE, for short</u>. The British goverment partly financed this study. The Amercian Psychological Association published the findings. Using body language and facial experssions to catch someone in a lie is really hard. <u>And it only workes, seemingly, by chance</u>. Thomas Ormerod is the head of the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England.  <u>On the APA website, he reported that the "suspicious-signs method" -- or using body language --"almost completely fails" in finding lies</u>. In the conversational CCE method, security agents just talk with passengers. <u>Then the agent observers if the person becomes more evasive or erratic</u>. They also observe if their way of speaking changes. Ormerod says that for actual passengers, they are "just chatting about themselves. <u>it shouln't feel like an **interrogation**</u>."

what if I don't pass my exams：如果我考试不通过会怎么样？

2）appear to：看起来……

3）look sb in the eye：直视；正视某人

In Xihua's report about the lanuch, it said machine learning was used to examine video images and sounds of the two newsmen.

On china's Twitter-like service Weibo several users wrote that the news readers have "no soul".  One user joked:"What if we had a AI leader of China?"

## 问答

```
“Recently, China’s state-supported news agency Xinhua launched what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters.”
```

在这个句子中，what之后的部分是什么从句？为什么用what而不用that引导？

what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters”是宾语从句，what在句中作launched的宾语。在名词性从句中，连接代词（即wh-一类的疑问代词）在从句中充当某一成分；而that在从句中不充当成分。这里从句中called之后缺宾语，所以这里需要用what而非that。

## 全文

Heat has been used to control hair for hundreds of years. But how much is too much? If you're ever opened a very hot even, you konw that heat can burn you eyebrows off your face very quickly. A scientist from Purdue University in Indiana is trying to find a scientific answer on how hot is to hot **when it comes to** your hair. Many women and some men **are very particular about** their hair. Some people who have naturally curly hair **prefer to have it straightened.** Others with straight hair want to have curls.

Tahira Reid is one of those people. As an African-American women, she **is familiar with** the challanges of maintaining curly, or tightly curled hair. Putting her mechanical engineering training to work, Tehira Reid and other researchers at Purdue University are studying how heat treament **interacts with** different types of hair and how to prevent damage. Hair irons can take many shapes but are essentially clips or rods with heated surfaces.

Amy Marconnet is assistant professor of mechanical engineering. She says the team is seeing how heat and temperature relates to their research. In a Purdue University lab, team members designed a hair straightener tool - a flat iron with ceramic plates and temperature control. The attached it to a robotic arm that moved over pieces of hair. They monitored the temperature while the device straightened hair. What did the find? Their study found that the heat weakens or breaks a protein called keratin, **responsible for** the hair's shape, and temporarily changes it.

But nobody knows exactly at what level the heat can actually cause permanent damage. Researchers say early results are a bit inconclusive. **It turns out** that everyone's hair is different and that there's no exact temperature where hair straightening becomes hair damage. For example, people with naturally curly hair can suffer more damage from heat irons than those with straight hair. Mrs Reid says they will continue their research in the hope of finding what workd best without damaging  the hair.

## 问答

```
“She says the team is seeing how heat and temperature relates to their research.”
```

这个句子中存在几个从句呢？

在这个句子中，“the team is seeing... ”是says的宾语从句，省略了连接词that；而在这个宾语从句中，又有一个联系代词how引导的宾语从句“how heat and temperature relates to their research”，作seeing的宾语。在宾语从句中，连接词that一般可以省略；而连接代词（即wh-一类的疑问代词）在从句中充当某一成分，一般不可省略。
