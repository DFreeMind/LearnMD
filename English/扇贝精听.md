## 全文

What is the best way to watch someone who is telling a lie?  For a long time, the traditional method of identifying liars was to watch their body language, including facial expressions. **What if a person apears to nervous**?  What if the person appears to be nervous? **Is the person unable to look me in the eye**? Is he or she looking around the room? **What about other nervous movements, such as fidgeting or shfiting from side to side**?

Many people--from parents to police officers and airport security personnel -- depend on this method. **But does a person's body and face reveal the truth**? Not according to new study. **Taking, it seems, is the best way to smoke out a liar**. That is what researchers in the United Kingdom found out recently. 

**Their investgation took place at one place where lying cant get you into big trouble -- airport**. The researchers asked the volunteers to **pretend** they were real passengers and then lie to airport security agents. Some of the agents used spoken conversation-based methods to question these **make-believe** passengers.  <u>Other agents depended instead on the person's body language, like **lack of eye contact** and **showing signs of** nervousness</u>. <u>The agents taking wiht the passengers were **20 times more likely to** catch the liars.</u>

<u>The study found that these converation-based **techniques** can help you recognize when a person is lying to you</u>. Like many methods, this conversation method has a name. <u>It is called Controlled **Cognitive** Engagement or CCE, for short</u>. The British goverment partly financed this study. The Amercian Psychological Association published the findings. Using body language and facial experssions to catch someone in a lie is really hard. <u>And it only workes, seemingly, by chance</u>. Thomas Ormerod is the head of the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England.  <u>On the APA website, he reported that the "suspicious-signs method" -- or using body language --"almost completely fails" in finding lies</u>. In the conversational CCE method, security agents just talk with passengers. <u>Then the agent observers if the person becomes more evasive or erratic</u>. They also observe if their way of speaking changes. Ormerod says that for actual passengers, they are "just chatting about themselves. <u>it shouln't feel like an **interrogation**</u>."

Xinhua said it worked with the Chinese search engine Sogou to develop the AI **presenters**. The news readers - created by machine learning technology - are **besed on** two real-life Chinese newsmen. One is able to present newscasts in English; the other, in Mandarin Chinese. In Xihua's report about the lanuch, it said machine learning was used to examine video images and sounds of the two newsmen. The system  then created the AI robotic presenters, which look and sound like real people.

Xinhua said the AI presenters will be great improvement to the news team beacuse they "can work **24 hours a day**"  on its website and on social media. One of presenters even **promised to** "work tirelessly" to **keep people informed**. Xinhua claimed the AI newsmen were able to read the news "as naturally as" a human presenter. Some machine learning experts said the system showed off China's latest progress in voice recognition, text-to-speech technology and data analysis.

On social media, many  Chinese noted that the AI presents did not seem real.  People **criticized them for** not being more **lifelike**. On china's Twitter-like service Weibo several users wrote that the news readers have "no soul".  One user joked:"What if we had a AI leader of China?" Others wondered about the effects robots might have on employment and workers. "It all comes down to production costs, which will determine if we loss jobs," one Weibo user wrote.

## 问答

```
“Recently, China’s state-supported news agency Xinhua launched what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters.”
```

在这个句子中，what之后的部分是什么从句？为什么用what而不用that引导？

what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters”是宾语从句，what在句中作launched的宾语。在名词性从句中，连接代词（即wh-一类的疑问代词）在从句中充当某一成分；而that在从句中不充当成分。这里从句中called之后缺宾语，所以这里需要用what而非that。

## 全文

Heat has been used to control hair for hundreds of years. But how much is too much? If you're ever opened a very hot even, you konw that heat can burn you eyebrows off your face very quickly. A scientist from Purdue University in Indiana is trying to find a scientific answer on how hot is to hot **when it comes to** your hair. Many women and some men **are very particular about** their hair. Some people who have naturally curly hair **prefer to have it straightened.** Others with straight hair want to have curls.

Tahira Reid is one of those people. As an African-American women, she **is familiar with** the challanges of maintaining curly, or tightly curled hair. Putting her mechanical engineering training to work, Tehira Reid and other researchers at Purdue University are studying how heat treament **interacts with** different types of hair and how to prevent damage. Hair irons can take many shapes but are essentially clips or rods with heated surfaces.

Amy Marconnet is assistant professor of mechanical engineering. She says the team is seeing how heat and temperature relates to their research. In a Purdue University lab, team members designed a hair straightener tool - a flat iron with ceramic plates and temperature control. The attached it to a robotic arm that moved over pieces of hair. They monitored the temperature while the device straightened hair. What did the find? Their study found that the heat weakens or breaks a protein called keratin, **responsible for** the hair's shape, and temporarily changes it.

But nobody knows exactly at what level the heat can actually cause permanent damage. Researchers say early results are a bit inconclusive. **It turns out** that everyone's hair is different and that there's no exact temperature where hair straightening becomes hair damage. For example, people with naturally curly hair can suffer more damage from heat irons than those with straight hair. Mrs Reid says they will continue their research in the hope of finding what workd best without damaging  the hair.

Samsung has provided the public a first look at its new foldable smartphone. The device was shown for the first time Wednesday during a Samsung developer's conference in San Francisco, California. The South Korea-based technology company first announced plans to build a fully foldable phone five years ago. The phone is designed to fold open to make the device the size of a small tablet. It can also perform some operations of a tablet. When folded closed, the device looks and works like a normal smartphone.

Justin Denison is Samsung's senior vice president of mobile product marketing. He introduced the device to people at the conference. Denison demonstrated the device, which he said marked a major breakthrough in future smartphone technology. "It's finally here. When it's open, it's a tablet, offering a big screen experience. When it's closed, it's a phone that fits neatly inside your pocket." He said the design and developmen of the foldable device was every complex. He said  Samsung had to invent new manufacturing materials and methods and "re-imagine the display from the ground up." He said one of the biggest diffculties was finding a material that was flexible, but also strong enoungh to support repeated folding and unfolding of the device. 

Technology experts see the new foldable design was a way to get users to buy a new device seen as revolutionary. More people are deciding to hold onto smartphone longer because newly launched models do not offer major improvements and can be very costly. The behavior is one readson for a steady decrease in worldwide smartphone sales over the past year. Research company IDC reported smartphone sales fell by 4 percent during the 12-month period ending in September 2018. Samsung, The world's leading seller of smartphone, suffered a 7 percent drop during the period, IDC said. It remains to be seen whether foldable phones will become popular quickly.

## 全文

A huge lake of salty appears to be buried deep in Mars, scientists reported this week.  The presence of water raises the chances of finding life on the red planet. The dicovery is based on observations by European spacecraft. It has excited experts. Water is necessary for life, and scientists have long hoped to prove that it is present on Mars. Cassie Stuurman is a geophysicist at the University of Texas. In 2016, she found evidence of a huge ice deposit on Mars. "If these researchers are right, this is the first time we've found evidence of a large water body on Mars," Stuurman said.

Scott Hubbard, a professor of astronautics at Stanford University, is also excited about the discovery. He served as NASA's first Mars program director in 2000. He said NASA has long believed in "following  the water." He is pleased that the new discovery supports that idea. The study was published in journal Science. Researchers are not yet sure how deep the area of water is. To find the water, Italian researchers examined radar signals. The signals were collected over three years by the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft. Researchers spent at least two years examining the data to make sure they had found water - and not ice or another substance.

Mars is very cold, but salt in the water may have kept it from freezing. It is the same as when you put salt on a road to prevent ice from forming, said Kirsten Siebach. She is a planetary geologist at Rice University. Siebach added that such conditions are not ideal for life to form. But, she said, there are bactria on Earth that have been able to survive in similar conditions. Mars has been a popular planet for exploration, with some groups placing instruments on its surface and others examining it from space. In May, NASA launched another spacecraft, the InSight Mars lander. It will dig under the surface after it reaches a flat area of the planet in November.



## 词组

1）appear to：看起来

No one appeared to notice me: 似乎没人注意到我

2）raise the chances of……：提高了……的可能性

Hard work raises the chances of achieving your goal. 努力工作会让你更有可能达到目标

I have long  hoped to meet my idol：我一直以来都希望见到我的偶像

4）prevent……from……：防止……发生……

Certain measurements are put in place to prevent the price of oil from dropping. 一些措施已经被落实来防止有家继续下跌

5）be ideal for……：对……很理想

This small town is ideal for me to relax: 这小镇对我来说是理想的休闲地。

## 问答

```
“He is pleased that the new discovery supports that idea.”
```

这个句子中that引导的是什么从句呢？

句中that引导的从句作形容词pleased的宾语，这是一种比较特殊的宾语从句。该从句具体说明了pleased的对象，因此有些语法书也会将这种从句视为补语从句或方式状语从句。这些说法都是合理的。

## 全文

Today we talk about something common to everyone around the world. Laughing is one of life's most simple pleasures. It is free. You can do it anywhere. And it makes you feel good! There is another thing you should know about laughter: Laughter is contagious. Like the flu, laughter can spread easily among people. Often when we hear someone laughing in a crowed room or a packed train, for example, we start laughing too - even if we have no idea why. But unlike the flu, even a good handwashing will not protect you againist breaking into a fit of laughter. Your eyes water, your heart rates goes up and your face gets that beautiful laughter glow.

In fact, many doctors say that mental health can affect physical health. You may even say, "Laughter is the best medicine." However, "laughter is the best medicine" does not mean that you should not take medicine when you are sick. It simply means that having a positive outlook might help ease your troubles. Making others laugh with you is an act of joy and kindness. 

However, the opposite is true when people laugh at you. That experience is lonely and no fun at all. For example, a teacher falls on hard times and loses his apartment. So, for a couple of days he sleeps in his car outside of the schoool. As it happens, at night he sleeps in bright pink, full-body pajamas with a hood and bunny ears. And he holds a teddy bear. Well, some cruel students record him sleeping in his car and share the video with their classmates. The teacher becomes the laughtingstock of the whole school. That was a mean thing to do. Well, yes, Yes, It was. But our story does not end there. The students post the video online, and it goes vitral! More than 10 million people watch it on YouTube! So, the teacher gets a dozens of offers to make commercials for pajamas and teddy bears. He make a lot of money. So, In the en, you could say the teacher definitely had the last laugh. When you have the last laugh, you end up winning when at first you were losing. It may be difficult. But if you have the choice to laugh or cry, choose laughter. For one thing, you may inspire others to laugh, too.

 Researchers say they have created a new super-material in the laboratory. They say it is stronger, lighter and costs less than steel. But the new material is not a porduct of high technology or a metallic substance. It is wood. Researchers Liangbing Hu and Teng Li are with the University of Maryland in the United States. By using of a few chemcials, heat and pressure, they have made wood 3 time better and 10 times stronger. Hu says that means it can complete with some of the world's strongest materials. "We're interested in replacing steel and carbon fibers with strong wood structures," he said. The process does not require any special raw, unprocessed material. Hu said that means the cost of the product will be relatively low. He added, "We can start with very cheap wood, and we can also start with very fancy, expensive wood. But in the end, ultimately we get very similiar performance."

The researchers are calling their product "super wood."  The researchers say the wood is strong enough to build automobiles, airplanes, wind turbines and more. A report on their findings was published in the journal Nature. The researchers say super-strength wood would hava less of an effect on the environment than the steel or other metals it could replace. However, their process is not pollution-free. It uses some of the same chemicals involved in making paper. Researcher Teng Li says he and Hu are finding many new ways to use wood, Including creating batteries and see-through wood and paper. "Wood has been existing on Earth (for) more than a millio years. And human beings have been using wood for furniture, construction (for) more than 10 thousand years. And then the more we worked on this material, we realized, we have never fully exhausted the potential of this amazing material." Other scientists are finding new uses for wood as well. Researchers in Sweden have reported making wood-based super-strong fibers for clothing and other materials.

Kropfl is very hard-working 12-year-old. You heard right. The San Clemente, California, boy just completed seventh grade.  And, school had a lot to do with the creation of his company. His story is proof that necessity is truly the mother of invention. Carson had enjoyed skating for years. He liked to use his skateboard to go to places, including school. But over time, he grew increasingly frustated that he had no place to store his board once he arrived. As a student, he could not change the size of his locker. But he realized he might be able to change the shape of hie skateboard. And, from that small desire, a business war born.

Carson's parents agreed to help him make it happen. They searched around for the best tools for creating skateboards. Carson made his first sales in the room where students ate at his school. He put a few skateboards on a table and his schoolmates started buying them up. Within months, Carson had an agreement with a manufacturer. The young man says he has sold about 700 skateboards in under two years of operation. His skateboards come in a number of shapes and designs. Each one costs around \$100.  But not all the profit goes to Carson. Some money goes to a non-profit group that supports the health and well-being of a place close to his heart. Carson's hometown of San Clemente sits along a beautiful coastal area of the Pacific Ocean. And Carson, the surfer, wants the ocean to stay that way. The young business owner says he is not exactly sure what he will do when he grows up. But he sure will stay busy.

```

这个句子中的buying是动名词还是现在分词呢？

句中buying是start的宾语，所以加上ing变为动名词，这里并不是现在分词哦。在第一天的讨论中，我们说过动名词和不定式都可以作主语。现在我们知道，这两种非谓语也都可以作宾语。

`Start to do与start doing 的区别是什么？`

动名词表达的是： 状态，性质，心境，抽象，经常性，已发生的

不定式表达的是： 目的，结果，原因，具体，一次性，将发生的

# 精听11：Love or Harm

## 词汇

- amend：v. 修改
- aggressive：n. 攻击
- suicidal：adj. 自杀的
- observation：n. 观察评论

## 全文

For some parents, spanking a child who misbehaves is a common punishment. In fact, they may think that a physcial type of punishment is good for children and will teach them to  behave in the future. However, a leading group of child health specialists suggests that the opposite is true.  The experts say that spanking is not only ineffective, it may even cause long-term harm to the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently amened its policy on physical punishment for a child.

Released in October, the academy warns that spanking a child can cause long-terms effects. These effects include "aggression, brain changes, substance abuse and suicidal hehavior in adulthood." The report admits that not every child who is spanked will have these problems later in life. It makes this observation:"Although many children who were spanked become happy, healthy adults,  current evidence suggests that spanking is not necessary and may result in long-term harm."

In recent years, many American experts have been advising parents against the use of physical punishment. Many other countries have already banned corporal punishment. Sweden was the first nation to do so in 1966. Earlier studies have shown that coporal punishment can also affect a child's ability to think and learn.  In 2012, a Canadian study found that spanking children can cause long-term developmental damage  and may even lower a child's intelligence test scores. They found that such punishment makes children more aggressive and antisocial.

 They also found that it can lead to depression and drug abuse. A report on this study and its findings were published in The Canadian Medical Association Journal. The American Academy of Pediatrics also warns against using  strong verbal abuse or shame to discipline a child. These types of punishment can also cause long-term problems for a child. Instead, They suggest other types of punishment that are appropriate for the age of the child. For younger children, punishment could be  taking away a favorite toy. For older children, a parent can limit the time the child spends watching television or playing with computers or electronic games.

这个句子中的谓语动词为什么要用第三人称单数形式呢？

这个句子的主语是“a leading group of child health specialists”，这里强调“a leading group”作为一个整体出现，所以谓语动词suggest使用了第三人称单数形式。
