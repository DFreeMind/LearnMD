## 全文

What is the best way to watch someone who is telling a lie?  For a long time, the traditional method of identifying liars was to <font color='red'>watch their body language, including facial expressions</font>. What if a person apears to nervous?  What if the person appears to be nervous? Is the person unable to look me in the eye? Is he or she looking around the room? What about other nervous movements, such as fidgeting or shfiting from side to side?

Many people--from parents to police officers and airport security personnel -- depend on this method. But does a person's <font color='red'>body and face reveal the truth</font>? Not according to new study. Taking, it seems, is the <font color='red'>best way to smoke out a liar</font>. That is what researchers in the United Kingdom found out recently. 

Their investgation took place at one place where lying cant get you into big trouble -- airport. The researchers <font color='red'>asked the volunteers to pretend</font> they were real passengers and then <font color='red'>lie to airport security agents</font>. Some of the agents <font color='red'>used spoken conversation-based methods to question</font> these make-believe passengers.  Other agents depended instead on the person's body language, like <font color='red'>lack of eye contact</font> and <font color='red'>showing signs of nervousness</font>. The agents <font color='red'>taking wiht the passengers</font> were 20 times <font color='red'>more likely to catch the liars</font>.

The study found that these converation-based techniques can <font color='red'>help you recognize when a person is lying to you</font>. Like many methods, this conversation method has a name. It is called Controlled Cognitive Engagement or CCE, for short. The British goverment partly financed this study. The Amercian Psychological Association published the findings. Using body language and facial experssions to catch someone in a lie is really hard. And it only workes, seemingly, by chance. Thomas Ormerod is the head of the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England.  On the APA website, he reported that the "suspicious-signs method" -- or using body language --"almost completely fails" in finding lies. In the conversational CCE method, security agents just talk with passengers. Then the agent observers if the person becomes more evasive or erratic. They also observe if their way of speaking changes. Ormerod says that for actual passengers, they are "just chatting about themselves. it shouln't feel like an interrogation."

Technology is forever changing <font color='red'> the way we get our news</font>. Many people now get a lot of their news on electronic devices, instead of traditional media, such as newpapers, television or radio.  An increasing number of people also report <font color='red'>turning to social media for information</font>. Now, There is a new technology that could greatly the way we get the news: computer-created news readers.

 Recently, China's state-supported news agency Xinhua launched what i called the world's first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters. Xinhua said it worked with the Chinese search engine Sogou to develop the AI presenters. The news readers - created by machine learning technology - <font color='red'>are besed on two real-life Chinese newsmen</font>. One <font color='red'>is able to present newscasts in English</font>; the other, in Mandarin Chinese. In Xihua's report about the lanuch, it said machine learning was used to examine video images and sounds of the two newsmen. The system  then created the AI robotic presenters, <font color='red'>which look and sound like real people</font>.

Xinhua said the AI presenters will be great improvement to the news team beacuse they "can work 24 hours a day"  on its website and on social media. One of presenters even promised to "work tirelessly" to keep people informed. Xinhua claimed the AI newsmen were able to read the news "as naturally as" a human presenter. Some machine learning experts said the system showed off China's latest progress in voice recognition, text-to-speech technology and data analysis.

On social media, many  Chinese noted that the AI presents did not seem real.  People criticized them for not being more lifelike. On china's Twitter-like service Weibo several users wrote that the news readers have "no soul".  One user joked:"What if we had a AI leader of China?" Others wondered about <font color='red'>the effects robots might have on employment</font> and workers. "It all comes down to production costs, which will determine if we loss jobs," one Weibo user wrote. Some people argued that only <font color='red'>low-level jobs requiring heavy labor</font> will <font color='red'>be easily replaced by robots</font>. Others praised the technology <font color='red'>as way for companies to make money</font> from low-cost labor machines.

## 语法

```
“Recently, China’s state-supported news agency Xinhua launched what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters.”
```

在这个句子中，what之后的部分是什么从句？为什么用what而不用that引导？

what it called the world’s first artificial intelligence, or AI news presenters”是宾语从句，what在句中作launched的宾语。在名词性从句中，连接代词（即wh-一类的疑问代词）在从句中充当某一成分；而that在从句中不充当成分。这里从句中called之后缺宾语，所以这里需要用what而非that。

# 精听04：How Hot is Too Hot for Your Hair

## 词汇

eyebow：n. 眉毛

particular：adj. 挑剔的

straighten: v. 使边直

mechanical：adj. 机械的

clip：n. 夹子

rod：n. 杆子

ceramic：adj. 陶瓷的

protein：n. 蛋白质

keratin：n. 角蛋白

permanent：adj. 长久的

inconlusive：adj. 不确定的



## 全文

Heat <font color='red'>has been used to control hair</font> for hundreds of years. But how much is too much? If you're ever opened a very hot even, you konw that heat can <font color='red'>burn you eyebrows off your face</font> very quickly. A scientist from Purdue University in Indiana is trying to find a scientific answer on how hot is to hot <font color='red'>when it comes to your hair</font>. Many women and some men <font color='red'>are very particular about their hair</font>. Some people who have naturally curly hair prefer to have it straightened. Others with straight hair want to have curls.

Tahira Reid is one of those people. As an African-American women, she is familiar with the challanges of maintaining curly, or tightly curled hair. Putting her mechanical engineering training to work, Tehira Reid and other researchers at Purdue University are studying how heat treament interacts with different types of hair and how to prevent damage. Hair irons can take many shapes but are essentially clips or rods with heated surfaces.

Amy Marconnet is assistant professor of mechanical engineering. She says the team is seeing how heat and temperature relates to their research. In a Purdue University lab, team members designed a hair straightener tool - a flat iron with ceramic plates and temperature control. The attached it to a robotic arm that moved over pieces of hair. They monitored the temperature while the device straightened hair. What did the find? Their study found that the heat weakens or breaks a protein called keratin, <font color='red'>responsible for the hair's shape</font>, and <font color='red'>temporarily changes it</font>.

But nobody knows exactly <font color='red'>at what level</font> the heat <font color='red'>can actually cause permanent damage</font>. Researchers say early results are a bit inconclusive. It turns out that everyone's hair is different and that there's no exact temperature where hair straightening becomes hair damage. For example, people with naturally curly hair can <font color='red'>suffer more damage from heat irons</font> than those <font color='red'>with straight hair</font>. Mrs Reid says <font color='red'>they will continue their research</font> in the hope of <font color='red'>finding what workd best</font> without damaging  the hair.

## 语法

```
“She says the team is seeing how heat and temperature relates to their research.”

这个句子中存在几个从句呢？

在这个句子中，“the team is seeing... ”是says的宾语从句，省略了连接词that；而在这个宾语从句中，又有一个联系代词how引导的宾语从句“how heat and temperature relates to their research”，作seeing的宾语。在宾语从句中，连接词that一般可以省略；而连接代词（即wh-一类的疑问代词）在从句中充当某一成分，一般不可省略。

Samsung has provided the public a first look at its new foldable smartphone. The device was shown for the first time Wednesday during a Samsung developer's conference in San Francisco, California. The South Korea-based technology company first announced plans to build a fully foldable phone five years ago. The phone is designed to fold open to make the device the size of a small tablet. It can also perform some operations of a tablet. When folded closed, the device looks and works like a normal smartphone.

Justin Denison is Samsung's senior vice president of mobile product marketing. He introduced the device to people at the conference. Denison demonstrated the device, which he said marked a major breakthrough in future smartphone technology. "It's finally here. When it's open, it's a tablet, offering a big screen experience. When it's closed, it's a phone that fits neatly inside your pocket." He said the design and developmen of the foldable device was every complex. He said  Samsung had to invent new manufacturing materials and methods and "re-imagine the display from the ground up." He said one of the biggest diffculties was finding a material that was flexible, but also strong enoungh to support repeated folding and unfolding of the device. 

Technology experts see the new foldable design was a way to get users to buy a new device seen as revolutionary. More people are deciding to hold onto smartphone longer because newly launched models do not offer major improvements and can be very costly. The behavior is one readson for a steady decrease in worldwide smartphone sales over the past year. Research company IDC reported smartphone sales fell by 4 percent during the 12-month period ending in September 2018. Samsung, The world's leading seller of smartphone, suffered a 7 percent drop during the period, IDC said. It remains to be seen whether foldable phones will become popular quickly.

# 精听07：Waters On Mars(again)

## 全文

A huge lake of salty appears to be buried deep in Mars, scientists reported this week.  The presence of water raises the chances of finding life on the red planet. The dicovery is based on observations by European spacecraft. It has excited experts. Water is necessary for life, and scientists have long hoped to prove that it is present on Mars. Cassie Stuurman is a geophysicist at the University of Texas. In 2016, she found evidence of a huge ice deposit on Mars. "If these researchers are right, this is the first time we've found evidence of a large water body on Mars," Stuurman said.

Scott Hubbard, a professor of astronautics at Stanford University, is also excited about the discovery. He served as NASA's first Mars program director in 2000. He said NASA has long believed in "following  the water." He is pleased that the new discovery supports that idea. The study was published in journal Science. Researchers are not yet sure how deep the area of water is. To find the water, Italian researchers examined radar signals. The signals were collected over three years by the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft. Researchers spent at least two years examining the data to make sure they had found water - and not ice or another substance.

Mars is very cold, but salt in the water may have kept it from freezing. It is the same as when you put salt on a road to prevent ice from forming, said Kirsten Siebach. She is a planetary geologist at Rice University. Siebach added that such conditions are not ideal for life to form. But, she said, there are bactria on Earth that have been able to survive in similar conditions. Mars has been a popular planet for exploration, with some groups placing instruments on its surface and others examining it from space. In May, NASA launched another spacecraft, the InSight Mars lander. It will dig under the surface after it reaches a flat area of the planet in November.

This small town is ideal for me to relax: 这小镇对我来说是理想的休闲地。

## 语法

```
“He is pleased that the new discovery supports that idea.”
```

这个句子中that引导的是什么从句呢？

句中that引导的从句作形容词pleased的宾语，这是一种比较特殊的宾语从句。该从句具体说明了pleased的对象，因此有些语法书也会将这种从句视为补语从句或方式状语从句。这些说法都是合理的。

There is another thing you should know about laughter: Laughter is contagious. Like the flu, laughter can spread easily among people. Often when we hear someone laughing in a crowed room or a packed train, for example, we start laughing too - even if we have no idea why. But unlike the flu, even a good handwashing will not protect you againist breaking into a fit of laughter. Your eyes water, your heart rates goes up and your face gets that beautiful laughter glow.

In fact, many doctors say that mental health can affect physical health. You may even say, "Laughter is the best medicine." However, "laughter is the best medicine" does not mean that you should not take medicine when you are sick. It simply means that having a positive outlook might help ease your troubles. Making others laugh with you is an act of joy and kindness. 

However, the opposite is true when people laugh at you. That experience is lonely and no fun at all. For example, a teacher falls on hard times and loses his apartment. So, for a couple of days he sleeps in his car outside of the schoool. As it happens, at night he sleeps in bright pink, full-body pajamas with a hood and bunny ears. And he holds a teddy bear. Well, some cruel students record him sleeping in his car and share the video with their classmates. The teacher becomes the laughtingstock of the whole school. That was a mean thing to do. Well, yes, Yes, It was. But our story does not end there. The students post the video online, and it goes vitral! More than 10 million people watch it on YouTube! So, the teacher gets a dozens of offers to make commercials for pajamas and teddy bears. He make a lot of money. So, In the en, you could say the teacher definitely had the last laugh. When you have the last laugh, you end up winning when at first you were losing. It may be difficult. But if you have the choice to laugh or cry, choose laughter. For one thing, you may inspire others to laugh, too.

## 全文

 Researchers say they have created a new super-material in the laboratory. They say it is stronger, lighter and costs less than steel. But the new material is not a porduct of high technology or a metallic substance. It is wood. Researchers Liangbing Hu and Teng Li are with the University of Maryland in the United States. By using of a few chemcials, heat and pressure, they have made wood 3 time better and 10 times stronger. Hu says that means it can complete with some of the world's strongest materials. "We're interested in replacing steel and carbon fibers with strong wood structures," he said. The process does not require any special raw, unprocessed material. Hu said that means the cost of the product will be relatively low. He added, "We can start with very cheap wood, and we can also start with very fancy, expensive wood. But in the end, ultimately we get very similiar performance."

The researchers are calling their product "super wood."  The researchers say the wood is strong enough to build automobiles, airplanes, wind turbines and more. A report on their findings was published in the journal Nature. The researchers say super-strength wood would hava less of an effect on the environment than the steel or other metals it could replace. However, their process is not pollution-free. It uses some of the same chemicals involved in making paper. Researcher Teng Li says he and Hu are finding many new ways to use wood, Including creating batteries and see-through wood and paper. "Wood has been existing on Earth (for) more than a millio years. And human beings have been using wood for furniture, construction (for) more than 10 thousand years. And then the more we worked on this material, we realized, we have never fully exhausted the potential of this amazing material." Other scientists are finding new uses for wood as well. Researchers in Sweden have reported making wood-based super-strong fibers for clothing and other materials.

Carson Kropfl is an inventor, business owner and environmental activist. He enjoys the excitement of surfing. In addtion to riding the waves, he likes riding his skateboard. Kropfl is very hard-working 12-year-old. You heard right. The San Clemente, California, boy just completed seventh grade.  And, school had a lot to do with the creation of his company. His story is proof that necessity is truly the mother of invention. Carson had enjoyed skating for years. He liked to use his skateboard to go to places, including school. But over time, he grew increasingly frustated that he had no place to store his board once he arrived. As a student, he could not change the size of his locker. But he realized he might be able to change the shape of hie skateboard. And, from that small desire, a business war born.

Carson's parents agreed to help him make it happen. They searched around for the best tools for creating skateboards. Carson made his first sales in the room where students ate at his school. He put a few skateboards on a table and his schoolmates started buying them up. Within months, Carson had an agreement with a manufacturer. The young man says he has sold about 700 skateboards in under two years of operation. His skateboards come in a number of shapes and designs. Each one costs around \$100.  But not all the profit goes to Carson. Some money goes to a non-profit group that supports the health and well-being of a place close to his heart. Carson's hometown of San Clemente sits along a beautiful coastal area of the Pacific Ocean. And Carson, the surfer, wants the ocean to stay that way. The young business owner says he is not exactly sure what he will do when he grows up. But he sure will stay busy.

这个句子中的buying是动名词还是现在分词呢？

句中buying是start的宾语，所以加上ing变为动名词，这里并不是现在分词哦。在第一天的讨论中，我们说过动名词和不定式都可以作主语。现在我们知道，这两种非谓语也都可以作宾语。

`Start to do与start doing 的区别是什么？`

动名词表达的是： 状态，性质，心境，抽象，经常性，已发生的

不定式表达的是： 目的，结果，原因，具体，一次性，将发生的

- amend：v. 修改
- aggressive：n. 攻击
- suicidal：adj. 自杀的
- observation：n. 观察评论

## 全文

For some parents, spanking a child who misbehaves is a common punishment. In fact, they may think that a physcial type of punishment is good for children and will teach them to  behave in the future. However, a leading group of child health specialists suggests that the opposite is true.  The experts say that spanking is not only ineffective, it may even cause long-term harm to the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently amened its policy on physical punishment for a child.

Released in October, the academy warns that spanking a child can cause long-terms effects. These effects include "aggression, brain changes, substance abuse and suicidal hehavior in adulthood." The report admits that not every child who is spanked will have these problems later in life. It makes this observation:"Although many children who were spanked become happy, healthy adults,  current evidence suggests that spanking is not necessary and may result in long-term harm."

In recent years, many American experts have been advising parents against the use of physical punishment. Many other countries have already banned corporal punishment. Sweden was the first nation to do so in 1966. Earlier studies have shown that coporal punishment can also affect a child's ability to think and learn.  In 2012, a Canadian study found that spanking children can cause long-term developmental damage  and may even lower a child's intelligence test scores. They found that such punishment makes children more aggressive and antisocial.

 They also found that it can lead to depression and drug abuse. A report on this study and its findings were published in The Canadian Medical Association Journal. The American Academy of Pediatrics also warns against using  strong verbal abuse or shame to discipline a child. These types of punishment can also cause long-term problems for a child. Instead, They suggest other types of punishment that are appropriate for the age of the child. For younger children, punishment could be  taking away a favorite toy. For older children, a parent can limit the time the child spends watching television or playing with computers or electronic games.

- productivity：n. 产量

## 全文

This  may seem impossible, but an American company is seeking to change farm animals by cutting or adding to their genes. By using  a process called gene-editing, the company, Recombinetics, says ti may be able to remove problem-causing genetic traits from some animals. Recombinetics says it can produce cows born without horns - those sharp objects on top of their heads.  The company must first persuade United States goverment officials that gene-edited animals are safe, and no different than the ones bred the traditional way. 

There has been debate as to wheter people would want to eat food that comes from gene-edited animals. Last month, The FDA announced an action plan thant described the steps it will take to support both plant and animal biotechnology, while safeguarding public health. To make this technology more acceptable, Recombinetics is not yet changing animals' genes to greatly increase their growth or productivity.  That could make the animals seem strange to people. Instead, the company says it is adding gene-edited traits to ease animals' suffering. "It's a better story to tell," Tammy Lee told the Associated Press. She is chief executive officer of the company, based in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Cow horns can hurt other cows, animals and peopel. Animal rights activists criticize the way farmers currently remove cow horns. The use hot irons or a caustic, burning substance to remove the bone. Critics question wheter using this technology is "playing God," doing something that is not natural. Paul Thompson is a professor of agriculture at Michigan State University.  He told the Associated Press that gene-editing may serve as evidence of how modern food production already treats animals. Thompson said there has been a debate for at least 20 years,  "of whether you need to change the animal or change the system."

Support for changing the genes may also depend on how the technology is used. For example, will it be used to help the animals , prevent disease, or increase productivity?  A Pew Research Center study last August found 43 percent of Americans supported genetically engineering animals for more nutritious meat.

McDonald's is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its world famous Big Mac. The big mac has been one of the most popular and best-selling items in the company's history. It is known for being bigger than a usual hamburger, with two pieces of meat seperated by an extra piece of bread in the middle. It is also made with special sauce and toppings. The Big Mac generally contains the same ingredients in McDonald's restaurants around the world. The Big Mac was invented in 1967 by JimDelligatti, the local operator of serveral McDonald's in the American state of Pennsylvania. He urged the company to let him sell the special hamburger at all restaurants that he ran.

Delligatti died in 2016 at the age of 98. In a 2007 interview with Reuters, he said it took a long time to persuade McDonald's that the Big Mac was a good idea. McDonald's finally agreed to let Delligatti sell the sandwich at one of his McDonald's restaurants. The company required him to use the same bun that other McDonald's burgers were made with. For that reason, Delligatti siad, id did not sell well at first. When he changed to a bigger bun - topped with sesame seeds - sales of the sandwich increased by more than 12 percent. After similar results at other stores, McDonald's decides to add the Big Mac to all its restaurants in 1968.

The Big Mac then grew to become an international food star. The Economist magazine has even used the price of the Big Mac to measure the purchasing power of different international currencies. To celebrate the Big Mac's lastiing popularity, MacDonald's is launching a series of collectible MacCoins. They will be available starting August 2 around the world. The company chose that day because August 2 would been Jim Delligatti's 100th birthday. The coins can be shared or collected.  People can also trade them in for a free Big Mac. McDonald's plans to give away more than 6.2 million MacCoins in more than 50 nations. The coins come in five designs,  each representing a different 10-year period with the Big Mac.

## 全文

It is common to see many different kinds of insects while spending times outside in the summer. Some of these tiny creatures do not dother people and can even add beauty to the natural environment. Examples of these are insects like ladybugs, butterflies and fireflies. Other insects can harm the environment or humans. Many are known to bite or sting. Some carry dangerous diseases.  This group includes insects like mosquitoes, ticks and cockroaches. The population of these insects seems to stay large and healthy. But scientists say this does not appear to be true for some flying insects that serve an important purpose.

There is growing evidence that these insects are decreasing across the world. Many of these insects are very important to plant growth and development. They also serve as a necessary link in the food chain and can help break down life when animals die. One researher looking into the current insect population is Doug Tallamy, a professor at the University of Delaware. He worries that a continual drop in the number of helpful insects could lead to disastrous. If the insects disappeared, Earth's important life forms would begin to go away too, Tallamy told the Associated Press. 

This could result in a total breakdown of the ecosystem.  "how much worse can it get than that?" he asked. Tallamy noted a statement by one of American's best-known biologists, E.O. Wilson of Harvard University. Wilson once called insects "the little things that run the world." Wilson is now 89 years old. He told the AP that he remembers walking through Washingto, D.C., in the past when it was "alive with insects, especially butterfies." Now, he said, "the flying insects are virtually gone."

Scientists say there are likely many reasons for the drop in flying insects. Most are related to the destruction of insect habitat caused by things like insecticides, other animals pollution and climate change. There have not been many studies done on the insect populations covering large areas. However, some international research suggests a downward turn.

The artwork was bought during an action Thursday at Christie's, an art house, in New York City. In a websit post, Christies's said the AI-created work was the first ever sold by a major auction house. It praised the sale as a signal of "The arrival of AI art on the wold  auction stage."

The  artwork, called "Portait of Edmod Belamy," was made by a machine learning algorithm. The AI system was created by members of an art collective called Obvious in Paris, France. It shows the portrait of a man, looking similar to subjects shown in historical paintings. Christie's described some differences of the AI-created work compared to other art it sells. For example, it said some parts of the face were not as clearly defined as those painted by artists. Also, some parts of the print were left empty.

Three creators from the group Obvious cooperated on the process that made the print. First, they put a collection of 15,000 portraits into a machine learning system. The portraits were painted by artists from the time period between the 14th and 20th centuries. Then a tool called the "Generator" made a new image based on the information entered into the system. After that, another tool, called a "Discriminator," attempted to find differences between the human-made image and one created by the Generator. "The aim is to fool the Discriminator into  thinking that the new images are real-life portraits. Then we have a result," Obvious collective member Hugo Caselles-Dupre said in a statement.

Obvious has created a series of  AI-produced art works. Caselles-Dupre said the team has experimented with other kinds of historical paintings. These included subjects from nature to paintings of the whole human body. But the results always came out better with portraits. This, he said, supports the idea that AI algorithms are not just good at copying other works, but can actually "emulate creativity."

## 全文

The number of giraffes has dropped by as much as 40 percent since the 1980s, says a new report on endangered species. The Red List is as study of threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The group now considers the giraffe "vulnerable" to extinction for the first time.  

Earlier, it had a rating of "least concern." The giraffes is the tallest animal on land. These beautiful creatures are one of the best-known species in Africa. They are known for their very long necks, long legs and the brown and white patterns that cover their bodies. Craig Hilton-Taylor is head of the Red List program. He says in 1985, there were between 152.00 and 163,000 giraffes. But now, he tells VOA, their numbers have fallen to about 98,000. 

What is causing this decrease?  Hilton-Taylor says: humans.  He says pollution and the effects of climate change are just a few of the other problems affecting the species. Some people are moving into protected areas where giraffeds and other animals live because of a lack of rain that affects food production. Somtimes the graceful, plant-eating animals are killed for their meat. Also, civil wars and unrest in Africa make it more difficult to protect the animals. It is harder to do conservation work - to protect the animals in danger - in areas of armed conflict.

Hilton-Taylor says the fact the giraffe is now listed as vulnerable means that it has "a high risk of going extinct in the wild unless we do something about it." But, he says giraffes can be helped. Some of the ideas that work include community involvement and tourism. Tourism, for example, provides jobs for local residents. He also says there needs to be a giraffe action plan put in place to observe and survey the animals across the continent of Africa. Hilton-Taylor adds that finding answers to the problems people face, like drought linked to climate change, food shortages and civil unrest, will provide answers to help giraffes.

“The number of giraffes has dropped by as much as 40 percent since the 1980s, says a new report on endangered species.”
```

这句话的主句是什么呢？

句中逗号前的部分是直接引语作宾语从句，后面的“says a new report on endangered species”是真正的主句，进行了主谓倒装。当直接引语作宾语从句置于主句，之后出现表示信息来源的主句时，主句常常会进行主谓倒装。

## 全文

Our bodies react to daylight. In fact, light is the most powerful environmental signal for re-setting our biological clock. Part of the job of the biological clock is to control when we sleep and when we wake. Light has a similar effect on a common insect: the fruit fly. So says Logan Roberts, a PhD student at the Univercity of California, Irvine. He was the lead writer of a report on the  subject.s

A long flight can affect one's  biological clock, sometimes for days. Air travelers can get very tired and develop unpleasure feelings when they fly great distances across time zoness. The natural order of things can become unbalanced on long, overseas trips from east to west or from west to east. In experiments, Logon Roberts and other researchers removed the brains of genetically-engineered flies. The insects' genes were changed for the purpose of this study. The researchers kept the brains alive in a laboratory. They used bursts of light to change their circadian rhythm by two hours. 

A ciracdian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle, a series of events or actions that happen in the same order, over and over again. This natrual system tells our bodies when to sleep and helps to control many other processes. This internal body clock is affected by environmental signals, like sunlight and temperature. Logan Roberts uses the word desynchronized when talking about the study and jet lag.  This means to cause a process that takes place at times or in cycles independent of another process. In unscientific terms, you might say "out of sync" or "out of whack." In this state of de-synchronized, he adds , communication between some neurons weakens. He says using light to temporarily reset your biological clock before you travel could help to reduce symptoms when you arrive at your final stop.

## 词组

4）in the same order：以相同的顺序

5）over and over again：一而再再而三的

## 全文

Once a week, a group of Egyptian women gather at a forgotten park outside of Cairo. There , they begin to run, jump and climb over walls and objects. The women are enjoying the sport of parkour. The activity is very unusual for women in the socailly conservation country. 

The sport of parkour started in France in the 1980s. Its name comes from the French word 'parcours', which means course or route. It involves moving through a city setting as fast as possible by running , climbing and jumping over, around or under any barrier in a path. The women have met every week for the past six months. Together, they hope to form Tgypt's first professional parkour team. Ten women took part in a recent training that centered on building upper body strength. They also learned different methods of dealing with surroundings. 

A crowd often forms to watch the women train. Egygtians are not used to seeing women playing sports in such an open, public area. Sometimes people take pictures or videos. Zayneb Helal is one of the parkour players. She told the Reuters news agency, "It is natural that people did not accept it because they were not used to it.  They did  not accept the idea that girls could play sports, let alone on the street." It is not common for women to play such sports on the streets in Egypt.

A 2017 Thomson Reuters Foundation study on how women are treated in the world's biggest cities rated Cairo as the world's most dangerous "megacity" for women.  Mohamed Omran guides the women in the training. They train hard on climbing barriers, landing correctly after jumpis, and noticing possibilities in the building around them. Parkour is not a common sport in Egypt. It has no govering group. But Parkour Egypt, a group made up of women and men, has grown quickly after starting off with just a few players. Helal said, "It needs more time to envolve and the sport needs to spread more so that people would learn about it."

## 全文

Some people are great at remembering faces. Once they meet you, they never foget how you look. They might say thing lik, "I never forget a face." or "I'm really good with faces." For some people , remembering a face can be diffcult. You may have to meet them serveral times  before they can recongnize you. For others, remembering a face is simply impossible. Such people have a condition of the brain called "face blindness."  Its actual name is developmental prosopagnosia, or DP for short.

Experts say DP can differ greatly from patient to patient. In less severe cases, people are unable to describe the face of someone they are have just met. In severe cases, people cannot even recognize theire own children in a group photograph. Many people who have DP show no clear signs. Take, for example, Dacia Reid. If you met her, you probably would not know that she suffered brain damage as a child. There would be no sign of it until you meet her a second time. She would not remember how you looked. 

Face blindness was once thought to be very rare. But recent studies have shown that it might be more common than experts had thought. The latest study on face blindness comes from th Prosopagnosia Research Centers at Dartmouth College in the United States. Bradley Duchaine is a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Duchaine says that the research showed "nerual abnormalities in many people with DP are more widespread than previous studies have suggested."

Duchaine says that studying face blindness may help researchers understand how the brain work. For example , Duchaine says his ream wanted to see if the brain recognized people and things in the same way.  So, the researchers tested how well people with face blindness could recognize common objects, such as cars. They found that people with DP may not have  been able to remember faces, but they could recognize objects, scenes and bodies. He says that suggests that faces are processed differently in the brain. Duchaine says this study on face blindness will not directly lead to any treatments. However, he said it could lead to a deeper understanding of how we all remember the world around us.
