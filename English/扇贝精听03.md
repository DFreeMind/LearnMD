## 全文

Caffeine is the most wildely used drug in the world. Many people drink coffee or tea to help them wake up in the morning. And many others drink caffeine throughout the day to prevent sleepiness. So, it is no surprise that if you get too much caffeine before bedtime, it can keep you awake. It turns  out than interrupting your sleep is bad for your health on many levels, including the cellular level. 

A new study explains how interrupted sleep can affect your mental and physical health. The study also explores how poor sleep can affect the cells in your body. Researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom have joined from across the pond to investigate this issue. The investigators are from the University of Colorado, Boulder in the U.S. and the Medical Research Councila Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. They found that caffeinated drinks taken up to three hours before expected bedtime can delay normal sleep times by as much as 40 minutes. The amount of caffeine that disrupted sleep was equal to about two shots of expresso. 

Kenneth Wright is head of the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder. Mr. Wright warns some caffee drinks sold in coffee shops usually contain more caffeine than that. Scientists have known for a long time that  caffeine keeps you awake. Caffeine affects the chemicals in the brain that control wakefulness. Caffeine also blocks chemicals in the brain that promote, or cause you to sleep. And interrupted sleep is not good for you. Not getting enough sleep can affect a person's mood. It also disrupts the body's natural sleep-wake cycle called the circadian rhythm. Your body's circadian rhythm is found in cells throughout the entire body. So, when  caffeine disrupts you circadian rhythm, it affects hormone production and the re-growth of new cells in the human body. And this can play a role in many health problems - from obesity to diabetes to cancer.

An American photograhper is making copies of great artwork available for blind individuals and those with very poor eyesight. At least 285 million people worldwide are either blind or considered visually impaired. They are  unable to see or enjoy visual final art.

Romeo Edmead lost his eyesight when he was only two years old. But that has not stopped him from living life to the fullest. He went to college and studied journalism. He now lives in New York and produces a podcast about the city. He depends heavily on his others senses. But he cannot exprience the great works of art in New York City. Romeo is now able to use his fingers to trace art paintings. He can get an idea of the appearance by following the makings. 

John Olson once worked as a photographer for LIFE magazine. He developed a printing process to make the art of Da Vinci and Van Gogh tangible for visually-impaired individuals. "I began to realize how important images have been to me, what they have allowed me to do. And it caused me to wonder what it was like for the blind, not having access to images." 

Olson's company is called 3D Photoworks. It produces copies of artwork in three dimensions: height, width and depth. Olson says this is how the process works. First, a painting is scanned, and a 3D computer image is created. Then it is sent to a machine that digitally scuplts it. Then the original image is printed on top of the relief. The whole process can take up to four weeks. Olson says that creating art in this way gives a blind person a new experience. "When a blind person can interact with art and create their own opinions, it's freedom to them. It represents freedom, independence. People tell us it's a basic civil right." A painting called "Washington Crossing the Delaware" shows a major event during America's Revolutionary War with Britain. Romeo Edmead just experienced the painting for the first time. Thanks to new technology, 3D art may soon hang in art museums all over the world. It gives the visually-impaired the chance to experience the beauty of visual art.

The Sahel is one of the direst areas in Africa, but that may change if Earth's surface temperatures rise more than two degrees Celsius. Scientists say the Sahel could turn greener, with more plant life, because the higher temperatures would lead to more rainfall. More than 100 million people live in the Sahel. It strethches coast to coast --  from Mauritania and Mali in western Africa to Sudan and Eritrea in the east. The Sahel extends to the southern edge of the Sahara desert.

In recent years, the area has experienced worsening extreme weather. That includes mroe droughts -- periods of little or no rainfall. Some scientists are very concerned about pollution from greenhouse gases -- gases that trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. They warn that if such gases continue to increase with no limits, rising temperatures could change weather systems in the Sahel and other areas. Some weather models predict a small increase in rainfall for the Sahel. But there is a risk that the entire weather pattern will change by the end of the century. That is the opinion of researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

The size of the possible change is "mind-boggling," says the institute's Anders Levermann. If the Sahel receives mroe rainfall, it will mean more water for agriculture, industry and personal use. But in the first few years leading up to more rain, the area is likely to experience very erratic weather. That may mean extremely dry periods followed by destructive floods, the researchers said. They added that because it is hard to know what will happen when, it makes it hard for people to plan for these changes.Levermann said any extreme change would create a huge challenge to the Sahel. More than 100 million people who may be affected already face many "instabilities, including war," he said. There are a number of possible outcomes, which depend on the climate that eventually develops and whether people in the Sahel are perpared for changes, said scientist Jacob Schewe. "Climate change from burning fossil fuels really has the power to shake things up," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Can eating a chocolate bar every day really prevent age-related memory loss? No. Can eating chocolate cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner be good for your heart? Again, the answer is no. That would be too good to be true. But new researcher shows that large amounts of flavanols, substance found in cocoa, tea and some vegetables, many reverse age-related memory failure. 

Another study is looking to see if high levels of cocoa flavanols can help prevent heart attacks and strokes. Flavanols found in dark chocolate are known to increase blood flow in the part of the brain that contorls memory. They also help prevent heart disease by lowering blood pressure and "bad" cholesterol.  Brain processes decrease as we age. By the time we reach our 50s and 60s we may have trouble remebering simple things such as the names of new people we meet or where we put our car keys. 

Dr. Scott Small is a professor of neurology at Columbia University in New York City. He is the lead wirter of a research paper describing the effects of cocoa flavanols on brain activity. The study involved 37 volunteers aged between 50 and 69. Researchers gave them a high-level flavanol drink make from cocoa beans or a low-levels flavanols drink. For a period of three months, some subjects got 900 milligrams of flavanol a day. The others got 10 milligrams of flavanols each day. Brain imaging  and memory tests were given to each study subject before and after the study. Dr. small says that the subjects who had the high-level flavanol drink showed much improvement on memory tests. The researchers warns that more work is needed because this study was performed on a small group.

Dr. JoAnn Manson is the lead researcher of a four-year study involving 18,000 adults. This study will use flavanol capsules. Dr. Manson says that a person would have to eat ten times a normal amount to get the flavanols in just one flavanol pill. "The amount of chocolate that it would take in order to have this amount of cocoa flavanols would be more than ten times the amount that people would ordinarily eat." Dr. Small says a cocoa-based flavanol extract may be developed in the future. He says that more studies are needed to see how much flavanol is good for human health.

## 全文

"Who loves pizza?" is a question you almost never have to ask an American. A better question might be "Who doesn't love pizza?" Now, there is a place for all pizza lovers to gather: the newly-opened Museum o f Pizza. It can be found in America's pizza capital — New York City. A company called Nameless Network came up with the idea for the museum, known as "MoPi" for short. "It's often that the simplest idea are the best," said Alexandra Serio. She is with Nameless Network. 

The company used the popularity of pizza as a way to get people "looking at art and hearing about history in a different format," Serio explained. She added that Nameless Network asked many kinds of artists to create art works about pizza. They, in turn, provided large photographs, sculptures and huge installations. The Museum of Pizza is set up in a large space on the street level of the William Vale Hotel in Brooklyn, New York. 

MoPi is a "pop-up" museum — meaning it can be enjoyed only for a short time before being moved somewhere else. So far, the museum has had lots of visitors. More than 6,000 people came through the doors when it opened this month. Visitors seem to love MoPi's bright colors, which makes it perfect for taking selfies and other photographs for social media. Nameless Network's Alexandra Serio said that, in recent years, art museums have changed as they've aimed for younger visitors. They are becoming more interactive and photo-friendly, she said. 

Lydia Melendez had made plans to visit the pizza museum in April. For her, the experience was worth the wait. "I thought it was going to be kind of boring," she said. She imagined walking in and finding books on how to make pizza. But she was very pleased when her actual experience was different than what she had imagined. Pizza may be what was captured the interest of crowds. But the point of the museum has been to help people experience more art. Serio said the Museum of Pizza's crowds are unlike the crowds at more traditional museums. But MoPi is making art availabel to everyone.

## 全文

China is developing a system that recognizes individuals by theri body shape and walking movements. Systems that recognize human faces are already being used to identify people in crowds or as a secure way to unlock personal devices. The new system, known as "gait recognition," is already being used by police on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. 

The Chinese technology company Watrix developed the system. The company announced last month that it had raised $14.5 million  to speed up the development and sale of the technology. The system works in a similar way to face recognition. Cameras capture video of people in public places. Then, machines powered by artificial intelligence(AI) examine and study the video. Facial recognition systems identify the shapes and experssions on a person's face to identify them. 

The system records a person's shape and movements and then creates a model of the way they walk. Huang Yongzhen is a former researcher who co-founded Watrix in 2016. He told the Associated Press his system can identify people from up to 50 meters away. It is designed to work even when a person's face is covered or hidden. Huang says his gait recognition system is correct 94 percent of the time. This is below the success rate of many face recognition systems. But he says the system can still be helpful to police and for other commercial purposes. He also believes the system can be effective when used together with face recognition.

Gait recognition is not new. The technology has been researched by scientists in Japan and Britain and By U.S. defense officials for about 10 years. But attempts to sell the technology have been slow. One of the reasons the technology has not developed further is because the systems are more complex than facial recognition. Shi Shusi is a Chinese writer and commentator. He told the AP he is not surprised that the technology would launch in China before the rest of the world. "Using biometric recognition to maintain socail stability and mange society is an unstoppable trend," Shi said. He added:"It's great business."

Many college students have given up taking class notes by hand. Instead, they type on laptop or tablet computers. But scientists from Princeton University and the University of California say that that method is less effective. If you need to remember something, write it. Writing notes by hand is much better for long-term memory of ideas, or conceptual information. So, turn off your computer if you want to remember something. Computers can take your attention away from your work. They can be distracting. Computers provide the chance to send a quick message to a friend, check a sports' score, shop or watch a funny cat video. It is really hard to resist a funny cat video.

But scientists say computers may hurt performance in school, called academic performance. Here is what the research showed. Students who type notes on a keyboard often transcibe, or write down what the professor says word for word. The way write without really thinking about what they are writing. These electronic notes contianed more words. But scientsits say it leads to "mindless transcription."  Transcription means to record something exactly as your hear it. 

However , students taking notes long-hand, or by writing them need to first process the information they hear. Then they record just the main points, or summarize. The use fewer words. This is because people usually write slower than they type. This process of summarizing information leads to a deeper understanding, say the researchers.

In the study, students listened to teacher and then took a test. Some took notes by typing on a computer. The others took notes by writing them down. Both groups performed about the same in remembering facts. But students who typed their notes did much worse on conceptual questions. These questions required them to understand an idea. Those who typed also could not stop transcribing even after they were told to try to avoid it. So even if you want to stop typing what you hear word for word, you might not be able to. Also, researchers found that those who wrote their notes remembered conceptual information better a week later. Researchers believe that the students who wrote nots long-hand had deeper understanding of idea and concepts.

Most people do not look forward to going to the dentist. But they might actually enjoy visiting an American museum that explores the history fo teeth and dentistry. The Dr. Samuel D. Harris Nation Museum of Dentistry is at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. It was the world's first college to train dentists. With more than 40,000 items, the museum contains one of the largest dental collections in the world. Vistors can see some fo the tools used by early dentists to work on patients. Some of the old equipment looks like torture devices than dental instruments. Others shown seem fit for kings and queens. For example, Queen Victoria's dentist used instruments made of gold and pearls. The museum shows many examples of false teeth, along with explanations about kinds of material used to make them. One of the most popular areas shows a set fo false teeth once worn by American's first president, George Washington.

But the museum corrects a widely believed story that Washington's false teeth were wooden. They were actually made of animal bone. Historians believe the false teeth made it diffcult for Washington to eat and speask. They say this is likely why his second inaugural speech contained just 135 words - the shortest in history. Some early tools used to clean teeth were also made from animal parts. The cleaning end of the brushes often came from the hair of cows or other animals. The museum also shows teeth from a mix of animals and notes how they are different from human teeth. 

In addition, visitors can explore how teeth have long been used to solve mysteries and crimes. And, they can see the history of tooth replacement and learn about new technology that could grow replacement teeth. One part of the museum, called Mouthpower, contains large toothbrushes and mouths. The models show how bacteria can damage the teeth and let people practice cleaning methods. While visitors to this unusual museum might at times feel like they are in a dentist office, the experience is sure to be a lot more pleasant.

## 全文

Wild animals are known to listen to each other for warnings that predator are near. Some birds, for example, flee when neighbors make a loud noise to announce a snake's presence. The fairy wren is a small Australian songbird. It is not born knowing the "languages" of other birds.

But recent research says it can learn the meaning of a few importtant sounds. Andrew Radford is a biologist at the University of Bristol in England. He told the Associated Press, "We knew before that some animals can translate the meanings of other species' 'foreign languages', but we did not know how that 'language learning' came about." 

Radford and researchers at the Australian National University carried out the study in the country's National Botanic Gardens in Canberra. They attached to their bodies specially-designed, sound-producing equipment called "tweeter speakers." The wanted to see if fairy wrens would react to sounds of other birds even if they could not see them. The scientists first played the birds two recorded sounds that they likely had never heard before. One was a warning cry of an allopatric chestnut-rumped thornbill, a bird not native to Australia. The other was a computer-generated bird sound called "buzz." When  the 16 fairy wrens in the study first heard the sounds, they had no special reaction. The scientists then tried to train half the birds to recognize the thornbill's cry as a warning sound. They tried to train the other half of the birds to recognize the computre-generated "buzz" as a warning call. They did so by playing the sounds in addition to other noises that the birds already knew as warnings. These included teh fairy wren's own threat call.

After three days, the scientists tested what the birds had learned - and their students passed the test. The fairy wrens trained with the thornbill's cry, fled when they heard it. The group trained with the buzz, fled when they heard that sound. Neither group reacted to the sound taught to the other. Andrew Radford of the University of Bristol noted that the ability to learn to link sounds with meaning makes biological sense. "If you can only learn in the presence of a predator, that's quite dangerous," he said.
