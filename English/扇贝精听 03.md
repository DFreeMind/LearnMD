## 全文

Caffeine is the most wildely used drug in the world. Many people drink coffee or tea to help them wake up in the morning. And many others drink caffeine throughout the day to prevent sleepiness. So, it is no surprise that if you get too much caffeine before bedtime, it can keep you awake. It turns  out than interrupting your sleep is bad for your health on many levels, including the cellular level. 

A new study explains how interrupted sleep can affect your mental and physical health. The study also explores how poor sleep can affect the cells in your body. Researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom have joined from across the pond to investigate this issue. The investigators are from the University of Colorado, Boulder in the U.S. and the Medical Research Councila Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. They found that caffeinated drinks taken up to three hours before expected bedtime can delay normal sleep times by as much as 40 minutes. The amount of caffeine that disrupted sleep was equal to about two shots of expresso. 

Kenneth Wright is head of the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder. Mr. Wright warns some caffee drinks sold in coffee shops usually contain more caffeine than that. Scientists have known for a long time that  caffeine keeps you awake. Caffeine affects the chemicals in the brain that control wakefulness. Caffeine also blocks chemicals in the brain that promote, or cause you to sleep. And interrupted sleep is not good for you. Not getting enough sleep can affect a person's mood. It also disrupts the body's natural sleep-wake cycle called the circadian rhythm. Your body's circadian rhythm is found in cells throughout the entire body. So, when  caffeine disrupts you circadian rhythm, it affects hormone production and the re-growth of new cells in the human body. And this can play a role in many health problems - from obesity to diabetes to cancer.
