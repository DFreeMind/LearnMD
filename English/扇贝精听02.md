A new study suggests that the timing of a wound affects the speed  at which it heals. Wounds suffered during the day heal around 60 percent faster than those sustained at night. The study showed how the body's circadian rhythm controlled the healing of wounds. The circadian rhythm is like a clock or timer. It tells our bodies when to wake up, eat and sleep in a cycle -- a series of activities that  repeat themselves day after day. Each cycle lasts about 24 hours.

In the study, researchers found that skin cells moved faster to repair wounds sustained during the day. The researchers examined cells, mice, and burn injury databases. Specifically, their investigation found the following  information: Nighttime burns - burns suffered between 9 o'clock at night and 8 o'clock the next morning - were 95 percent healed after an average of 28 days. But after an average of 17 days, daytime burns - burns sustained between 8 o'clock in the morning and 8 at night - were 95 percent healed. In other words, nighttime injuries took an average of 11 day longer to heal.

The scientists say that circadian clocks play an important part in healing. Circadian clocks control many cells in the body and affect many biological processes, including sleeping. John O'Neil was a co-eader of the study. "This is the first time  that the circadian clock within individual cells has been shown to determine how effectively they respond to injuries," he said. Wounds are very costly to treat. Worldwide, billions of dollars are spent every year on wound- treatment services. Experts say the high costs result, in part, from a lack of drugs that speed up the closure of wounds.

The findiings , if confirmed by other studies, could have important implications for surgical operations and wound- healing medicines.  John Blaikley works at Britains Universtiy of Manchester. He said the new study's findings could help scientists develop better drugs. The findings, he added, could also help doctor understand the best time of day to do surgery or give medicine.

## 全文

Syrian-born artist Mohamed Hafez creates littles worlds inside of suitcases. One of his art works looks like a building that was blown open by a bomb. It has small pieces of clothing among the destruction to represent the people who once lived there. "I think the human eye is fascinated by the detail of destruction," he explains. "We are always curious to find out what happened." Hafez's art works show the damage caused by the seven-year civil war in his native Syira. "There's nothing glamorous about destruction," Hafez says, "but I use it as a way for me to heal and creatively weep over the destruction."

His art show, called "Collateral Damage," is being held at the Fairfield University Museum in Fairfield, Connecticut. It has artwork representing Syria before the war, Syria during the war and the experience of refugees. Hafez's representation of the refugee experience has won recgonition in the past few years. One reason is that the small scenes are placed in real suitcases - ones once carried by the refugees as the fled. "A lot of people came to me with their parent's and grandparents' suitcases." said Hafez. He added that the suitcases reminded people of their own immigrant history. Some of the suitcases go back to the 1800s. As the "belongings of yesterday's immigrants," they play a part in telling "the story of today's immigrants to remind us collectively that hsitory could repeat itself," Hafez said.

Hafez is an immigrant himself. He brings his own understanding of the refugee experience. Born in Damascus, Syria, he grew up in Saudi Arabia. He arrived in the U.S. 15 years ago as an architecture student. He came on a single-entry visa, which meant he could not go home for the first eight years. "This has caused a lot of homesickness and longing to the beautiful country that I have left. I started using leftove materials from architectureal model making. And I started remodeling old Damascus and old Aleppo in miniature form." Hafez believes he is providing something for "the American skylines" as a Syrian and Muslim.

## 全文

Tattos are no longer the sign of a sailor, soldier or criminal. They are wildly popular. In American today.  lots of people are getting tattoos -- especially younger people. Forty percent of men and women aged 26 to 40 years old have at least one tattoo, according to Astanza, a laser technology company. As a result, the American tattoo business is booming. In 1960, there were only about 50 professional tattoo artists in the United States, reproted The Atlantic.  By 1995, that number had soared to over 10,000. Today, IBISWorld reprots there were are almost 55,000 people working as tattoo artists in the U.S.

What's driving the wild popularity of tattoos? It could be a search for identity. "Tattoos , recent research suggest, don't just experss indentity, they help define it," writes Chris Weller in the Atlantic. In an area of  rapid and unpredicatable change, driven by technology, a tattoo can be a source of stability and permanence.This is particularly true for Milennials, who grew up with the internet, notes Weller. "Body art has taken on greater significance, and people want their ink to say something about who they are," he writes.

Tattoos are made by using a needle or other sharp instrument to inject various colors of ink into the skin. Modern tattoos have intricate patterns and use a wide range of colors. Decorating the body with tattoos is an ancient art that dates back to the Stone Age. Tattoos have been found in every part of the world. In many cultures, they are used for decoration, rites of passage or signs of status. In Russia, for example, a 2,500-year-old mummy of a Siberian princess was found about two decades age, sporting "remarking tattoos," wrote The Siberian Times. Some depicted mythological animals, a snow leopard, and a deer. They were strikingly similar to designs of modern tattoos. 

The tattoos removal business has grown along with the popularity of tattoos. As many as half of all people who get tattoos later get them removed, reports the Washington Institute of Dermatologic Laser Surgery. Dermatologists use laser treatments to get rid of tattoos, which range from \$ 3350 for a small tattoo, up to \$1,000 or more for a large one.

## 问答

```
“In Russia, for example, a 2,500-year-old mummy of a Siberian princess was found about two decades ago, sporting ‘remarkable tattoos’, wrote The Siberian Times.”
```

在这句话中，“sporting ‘remarkable tattoos’”是什么成分呢？

"句中“sporting 'remarkable tattoos'”是主语补足语，对从句的主语“a 2,500-year-old mummy of a Siberian princess”进行补充说明的作用，修饰的是具体的事物，所以并非状语（状语须修饰动词或者全句）。sport在此处是熟词僻意，作及物动词，表示“展示”、“夸耀”的意思。

这里是主补而非定语的原因在于：补语只起到补充说明的作用，而定语起到限定的作用。如果把这一部分理解为定语，那就说明除了“sporting 'remarkable tattoos'”之外还有其他的mummy，而这与句意不合。所以这里只理解为补语，而不是定语。"

## 全文

Amanda Greene lives with pain.  Greene says her pain comes from lupus, an autoimmune disease that attacks her organs and tissues. "If I don't have nerve pain, I might have joint pain.  If I'm not having joint pain, I might have headaches." She tried taking medicine and other treatments, but she suffered and allergic reaction to opioids, a strong painkiller. Now Amanda Greene is trying something different.

It is called "virtual reality" therapy. Virtual reality, or VR, is growinig in popularity in video gaming and some training programs. The person wears specials equipment that covers the eyes. Inside, he or she sees images and hears sounds coming from a computer program. The experience makes people feel as if they are in the picture they are watching. For Greene, virtual experience helped her feel more at ease and trained her to breathe in a special way. She saw a tree ,crystals, and her breath as she was guided to breathe in and out. "It worked. It works for me."

Brennan Spiegel is a doctor who treats patients with stomach pain and intestinal problems. He says these disorders are sometimes connected to a person's mental health. VR can help, he explains, by changing the messages in the brain and nervous system. Spiegel is the director of Heath Services Research at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California. He heads Cedars-Sinai's virtual reality program, where more than 2,500 patients have been treated. Spiegel said more than 100 hospitals nationwide are using VR to help patients control pain and nervousness. He added that more countries are taking an interest in VR, and doctors are beginning to develop policies on how to use the technology in health care.

Brennan Spiegel says the aim is not to have the patients stay in their virtual world forever. The idea , he says, is for people to learn in VR that they can control their bodies, and that the mind matters. And then, people can use those skills when they need it., in the real world.

## 全文

The  late-night television host, carpool karaoke king and father of three young children was taking  about the children's song "Baby Shark." Maybe you have not heard the song, but that seems impossible.In 2015, a South Korean educational content maker, Pinkfong, released its first "Baby Shark" video. Later, it broke the internet with a version that mixed animation and two loveable human kids.  The video shows them dancing to the story of a shark family, K-popstyle. The video has more than 2 billion views on YouTube. A group called Super Simple also has well-loved versons of the song, and YouTube provides a huge number of other "Baby Shark"  offerings to choose from.

Some parents of special needs kids think "Baby Shark" is more than fun. They argue it has helped their young ones. Holly Anderson of  the U.S. state Utah is a mother of four. Her 3-year-old son has autism, a disorder that can affect social skills, speech and other areas. Anderson said her son "has a very difficult time staying still, even for a moment, and usually spends his time running around in therapy." But she said the "Baby Shark" song and video helps her son calm down. 

Bob Cunningham is an educator and adviser for the nonprofit Understood.org. He praised "Baby Shark" as catchy and colorful. He added, "Both the music and the animation are predictable, with repeated words , phrases, colors and movements." The combinations can capture and keep children's attention,  even for children who have trouble paying attention, Cunningham said. The song and video also occupy most of the senses at the same tine and combine language with music and movement. 

In additon to being famous, "Baby Shark" sells. A Montreal-based company,WowWee, has a Pinkfong license for North America to sell the shark family in soft toys. The toys sing when pressed in the middle. The online marketplace Amazon took orders for the toys with guarantee that they would arrive by Christmas. WowWee's chief technology officer, Davin Sufer, said they sold out in less than three days. He said of the song, "Your hear it once or twice and you hear yourself singing, 'doo doo doo doo doo doo.' I could see maybe parents getting a little tired of it, but kids aren't."
