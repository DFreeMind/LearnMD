# 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum

In an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, how many **non-empty** subarrays have sum `S`?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= S <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is either `0` or `1`.



## Approach 1: Index of Ones

**Intuition**

Say we number the `1`s in `A`: $(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ with $A[x_i] = 1$.

Then, if we have a subarray of sum $S$, it has to use the ones $x_i, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_{i+S-1}$ . For each $i$, we can count the number of such subarrays individually.

**Algorithm**

In general, the number of such subarrays (for $i$ ) is $(x_i - x_{i-1}) * (x_{i+S} - x_{i+S-1})$ .

For example, if $S = 2​$, then in `A = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1]`, let's count the number of subarrays `[i, j]`that use the middle two `1`s. There are 2 choices for the `i` `(i = 1, 2)` and 3 choices for the `j` `(j = 4, 5, 6)`.

The corner cases are when $S = 0​$, $i = 1​$, or $i+S = n+1​$. We can handle these gracefully.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, A, S):
        indexes = [-1] + [ix for ix, v in enumerate(A) if v] + [len(A)]
        ans = 0

        if S == 0:
            for i in xrange(len(indexes) - 1):
                # w: number of zeros between two consecutive ones
                w = indexes[i+1] - indexes[i] - 1
                ans += w * (w+1) / 2
            return ans

        for i in xrange(1, len(indexes) - S):
            j = i + S - 1
            left = indexes[i] - indexes[i-1]
            right = indexes[j+1] - indexes[j]
            ans += left * right
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: $O(N)$, where N*N* is the length of `A`.
- Space Complexity: $O(N)​$. 



## Approach 2: Prefix Sums

**Intuition**

Let `P[i] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i-1]`. Then `P[j+1] - P[i] = A[i] + A[i+1] + ... + A[j]`, the sum of the subarray `[i, j]`.

Hence, we are looking for the number of `i < j` with `P[j] - P[i] = S`.

**Algorithm**

For each `j`, let's count the number of `i` with `P[j] = P[i] + S`. This is analogous to counting the number of subarrays ending in `j` with sum `S`.

It comes down to counting how many `P[i] + S` we've seen before. We can keep this count on the side to help us find the final answer.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, A, S):
        P = [0]
        for x in A: P.append(P[-1] + x)
        count = collections.Counter()

        ans = 0
        for x in P:
            ans += count[x]
            count[x + S] += 1

        return ans
```



## Approach 3: Three Pointer

**Intuition**

For each `j`, let's try to count the number of `i`'s that have the subarray `[i, j]` equal to `S`.

It is easy to see these `i`'s form an interval `[i_lo, i_hi]`, and each of `i_lo`, `i_hi` are increasing with respect to `j`. So we can use a "two pointer" style approach.

**Algorithm**

For each `j` (in increasing order), let's maintain 4 variables:

- `sum_lo` : the sum of subarray `[i_lo, j]`
- `sum_hi` : the sum of subarray `[i_hi, j]`
- `i_lo` : the smallest `i` so that `sum_lo <= S`
- `i_hi` : the largest `i` so that `sum_hi <= S`

Then, (provided that `sum_lo == S`), the number of subarrays ending in `j` is `i_hi - i_lo + 1`.

As an example, with `A = [1,0,0,1,0,1]` and `S = 2`, when `j = 5`, we want `i_lo = 1` and `i_hi = 3`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, A, S):
        i_lo = i_hi = 0
        sum_lo = sum_hi = 0
        ans = 0
        for j, x in enumerate(A):
            # Maintain i_lo, sum_lo:
            # While the sum is too big, i_lo += 1
            sum_lo += x
            while i_lo < j and sum_lo > S:
                sum_lo -= A[i_lo]
                i_lo += 1

            # Maintain i_hi, sum_hi:
            # While the sum is too big, or equal and we can move, i_hi += 1
            sum_hi += x
            while i_hi < j and (
                    sum_hi > S or sum_hi == S and not A[i_hi]):
                sum_hi -= A[i_hi]
                i_hi += 1

            if sum_lo == S:
                ans += i_hi - i_lo + 1

        return ans
```

- Space Complexity: $O(1)$.
